# About the docker image and it's contents
This image was created as a part of the team project artefact for the course: 'M. Grum: Advanced AI-based ApplicaGon Systems’ by the ‘Junior Chair for Business Information Science, esp. AI-based Application Systems' at the University of Potsdam. 

The data present on this docker image, was generated from an Image of the orion nebula, taken by Haani Ansari (Github: cosmonautinspace). Firstly, the data was uploaded to the repository of the project and then scraped from the same repository.
